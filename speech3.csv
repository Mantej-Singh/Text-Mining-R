 SO ADDICTING  DEFF DOWNLAOD ITS EPIC YOU CAT LOVERS WILL FALL IN LOVE <3,
 Great game I love this game. Unlike other games they constantly give you money to play. They are always given you a bone. Keep up the good work.,
" Sooo much FUN I would definitely recommend this game, it's fun for dress up and business. It's extremely entertaining, I'm hooked already. :)",
 AWESOME Epic game so addictive 5stars <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>,
 Good game Great game,
" Meh Used to be good until World Cup upgrade.
Now it lags all the time, making it difficult to play.
Maybe if you spent more time getting the game to actually work and less time trying to squeeze advertising into every nook of game play, we could have a winner.",

 Candy crush review Addictive,
 Great game Great game,
 Fun but I have a disagreement Whenever you try to play and it loads it doesn't work that is the only thing I do not like about subway surfers 3,
 Epic game!!!!! Download this game! Don't hesitate!,
 Platinum If u do Facebook to get platinum why do u only get one for all the stuff they post?,
" Obsessed Love this game, it's really cool except energy takes too long and 8hr missions frustrate me <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9> but other then that it's a real great game to get hang of <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C> thank you",
 Just fun Easy to get in to and fun!,
 Hay day It's a really good game. It is very entertaining when you are really bored and have nothing to do,
 Cool Good game,
 WHOO HOO!! Well I knew this update was coming but not when but since it's here WHOO Hoo!!! keep it comin plz!!,
 Amazing !! This app is the best app you can possibly find but the only thing I would want to change is kim when we go to buy stuff that cost k-stars can you make them way cheaper because no one can afford them but please download this game and enjoy the amazing life of Kim Kardashian xxxx,
" Good game spoilt I started playing this game and thought it was quite good until I had to progress by contacting 3 facebook friends, also waiting for energy and being on the same mission for at least two days, final result boring would be much better without facebook and waiting ,it says I have to rate this to send I'm giving you one star only because I have to",
 Not worth your time! A Joke!  This casino just keeps getting worse. You can buy millions and be lucky if it last a day. You don't get much in free coins. They took the Extra Button off so at times you can't get the free coins offered. Worthless Casino!  Most comments on their Facebook page are from upset people. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !,
 Hooked Hooked,
" Glad it's not real money ! Was good but all I get is poor connection and the reels just keep spinning then to top it all my ""big wins "" are lost ! Update needed ASAP",
 Awesome! A lot of fun!!,
 Double Cross Just chews threw chips...ridiculous odds.,
 Nice Fun game mantej,
 I love this game!!!! I just love this game. But I wish I didn't have to use data to buy and sell things!,
 Amazing game but stop working I have an iPod and the software is all up to date but all of a sudden I can't open up the game it just shuts down after a minute. Really loved this game hope it starts to work again soon please fix it!,
 Not as good as it use to be When I first downloaded the game it was good you could cheat and get extra gems through the casino but now as they have change it and it takes forever to get awarded new gems and takes even longer to finish a restaurant.,
 Error in patching Every time I try to log it it says error in patching but overall good game.,
 Great It is a great app the paid one is much better though but for free it is really fun!,
 Yay Yay,`
" GET THIS QUICK!!! Subway Surfers is the best game on the App Store! It's the only game I will play for hours- literally! You'll never get bored of the game because there are missions and awards and you can collect tokens to get characters and boards witch have special powers and... and... THE FUN NEVER STOPS!!! Every so often you can update the app and you will go to different countries but you won't lose anything you earned. What could be wrong with this app? Nothing! Nothing at all! 
<f0><U+009F><U+009A><U+00A8>YOU WILL GET ADDICTED<f0><U+009F><U+009A><U+00A8>",
 Awesome Mysterious Game!! Fun game to play @ night before bed to wind down!!,
 Very fun Nice graphic tons of fun,
" Need cash to compete. If you not prepared to spend thousands, don't bother.  Your outcome depends on how much you spend, which determines how strong you get. 

You can try the alternative and play without spending. It'll take you over a year to build the same power level and spender can make in 10 minutes. 

Members in my alliance and other alliances spend at least $200 daily per person. Generally the bigger ones will spend over $1000 every few days. 

It takes around $1000 to get to power level of 10 million. 
And 10 mill power is small fry.  Most are over 200 mill depending on how old the kingdom is. Generally a 2 month old kingdom has players over 220 mill power and average player is over 15 mill. 

So if you have money, this is an awesome game. Graphics are cool. Loads to do.",
 Wortha down load Decent game,
" Kim Kardashian I love the game, my favourite game but 1 energy every 5 minutes is too long it should be more like 1 energy every 1 minute. Apart from that it's great definitely recommend this.",
" Hay day suggestion I have a suggestion for the trees once they die, if we could possibly use the wood for handles, and melt iron down in the metals, and maybe we could get a ""wood shop"" and we could build our own axes/saws etc.....or a ""wood chipper"" something to assist us in breaking down all of the trees and shrubs.  Just food for thought for some new buildings, and a new way to produce something we can use.  Thanks for everything you do!  Great game!",
 Great One of the best mobile shooters I've played on iOS!!!!!! Soo gd,
 Subway surfs By Phil Coleman. It a great for everyone very good game to play,

 Good game Good game,

 Addictive fun Perfect fun,
 Wonderful Is a great game and addictive. Brilliant,
 Slots Romance Great game! I play it every day!,
 Gems!! Only gave you 1 star as you can't continue with any upgrades unless you have a really stupid amount of gems!! Fix the gem problem and this game would be great but at the moment it's just frustrating!!!,
" Game of Wallet This game used to be awesome but they keep changing to rules and game mechanics plus offering ""quests"" and ""events"" that actually send you backwards.

It's definitely a game for those with thousands of dollars (seriously, I mean it). I know of a few that are over $5000 in spending and am told that's nothing compared to others.

It would be very difficult for a new player to start in this game and have any hope of getting anywhere near even the middle of rankings.

You basically never know when the mechanics of the game will be moved (they can be massive changes) and need to play the game near most of your waking hours.",
 Ok Ok,
 Plumber crack Fun game,
 Addictive Love the game can't stop playing,
 Dkxnsmxlzkwmx Lol,
" SO EFFING ADDICTIVE This game is the definition of Awesome sauce! It's unbelievably addictive! Sadly we got a new and terrible Internet router and I can't update the game so I can't play at the moment, but apart from that this game is the opposite of <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9>
Good job<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>",
" Addictive Great looking, fun game",
 Addictive 'Nuff said.,
" They ticked all the boxes This is a really good thing the people at  at urban rivals made so know I can play it when I'm not in the house,yay!!!",
 Its ok.. The only thing that really grinds my gears is if your raid and get disconnected you don't get anything refunded if you have used gems for the raid..,
 Slow downloading Why has this game got so slow in downloading? Since the last update takes me ages to get from farm to farm and it keeps going off,
" Great!! I rarely rate apps and when I do there usually only great or crappy games, this is an awesome game had it for a while now. Please add clan vs clan battles and PvP. Then this will be best mmo on the AppStore",
" I AM ADDICTED-BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is so fun & addicting. Especially if you're bored-you play this game and trust me-you'll snap out of it. Fun farming. Just like living on a farm too!!! Just...not. So many customers, a roadside shop, sheep, pigs, horses, cows,chickens,dogs.
It goes on FOREVER!!!
BEST GAME EVER!!!!!",
 Fun Enjoying playing.,
 ADDICTIVE!!!! This is a fun and easy to play and lose!!,
" This game is a rip off Note it's practically impossible to enjoy this game without spending significant amounts of money. Game developers are exceptionally greedy. Also note the game is totally unfair with some player getting free upgrades without paying any money, apparently due to ""glitches"" in the game. You will regret playing this game.",
 Sweet Nice,
 Casino Love the games & interaction,
 Sick Luv it do more rovio,
 Plumbers Crack Good game to while away the hours.  Watch the sore ice flicking finger!,
" Terrible Downloaded the game and it keeps on lagging, I swipe the screen and my player doesn't move, deleted it straight away.",
" Good game but.... The game itself is fun to play. My only issue is that you have to constantly buy clothes and other items to keep up a ""professional"" and ""romantic"" appearance for dates and gigs. It's starting to become very taxing and I can't buy anything that isn't worth K-stars now. Everything else that is worth cash is extremely expensive and/or locked because I'm not high enough in levels. Please consider lowering prices or creating an easier way to earn more money besides watching a million ads...",
 Awesome Game!!! This game is so simple and very addictive. It's a game that you can spend hours playing. In my opinion Warriors is the best game out right now.,
 Grhrhrh Gmwl,
" Frustrated So i upgraded to ios 8 and i also upgraded my clash of clans app, and now my app is so much slower than before. I don't know if its the new apple software or the app but can you please fix the problem? Thanks. Also this game is the greatest game on the AppStore.",
" Fix it! I've lost all my archers and my alchemist! It's reverted me back to previous level and reset my materials after grinding for them.

Makes it more annoying that I've spent money on IAP!!!",
 Awsome Game! Name says it all,
 Fun I love it,
" Amazing Well worth playing,very addictive!",
" Not impressed Don't waste your time or money. Since day one this game has constantly froze or crashed. Get chips then crashes, reopen and they are gone. This game has never worked properly. It should be removed from App Store!",
 Good! Its a real good game ; && the movie :o,
 So Much Fun!! This game is so much fun to play and is so hard to put down.  I look forward to more settings and more objects to throw.,
 Driver Easy fun game,
 Candy It's a good game,
" Crashing! Love this game, but got to level 30, bought the land and pier, fisherman has turned up and game froze. Very very frustrating. Why? Would have given 4 plus stars otherwise. Please fix!",
 Entertaining Nice,
 Disappointed I love this game but they make it almost impossible to complete challenges unless you spend money or 24 hours a day playing. Not sure I will keep the game if this carries on,
 Fun Fast paced game so far.,
 Casino Very good great upgrades lots of fun free down load what great casino game lots to do,
 Miss Absolutely fabulous :) love it!,
 Awesome Awesome game,
 Amazing game!! ...,
" Very fun Addictive game, similar to a Tomogotchi. You will want to check in on your village and clan.  Building, building, building and re-arranging you village. Some battles too. Ver well constructed.",
 Takes too long to load Besides that its really nicee,
 Omg! Sooooooo cute game I love it! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0086>,
 Brilliant! I love it!,
 Challenging This game is very challenging and you'll get mad at it when you lose but it's still fun to play,
" Ups and downs It's fun(it gets frustrating though) but its a classic game and nothing will make me delete it.
P.s I agree with teneray, it is very good for a free app!!",
 Marna I love this game,
 10-Oct Great game,
 Enjoyable Game Fun,
 Miss Awesome fun,
 Chuck Norris dancing Fruity lion,
 Warrior Loads of fun,
 Pile of crap Worst game ever it only glitches and crashes it so stupid I tried it many times but just crashes  FIX IT,
 Not as much fun Still crashes after the last 2 upgrades. The game isn't as fun as it was prior to the new upgrades. Took away the magnet purchase and wiped out all the magnets that were accumulated.  Also increased the cost of things 1000%. Unfortunate...On to something new.,
 Me Wicked game!,
 Frighteningly addictive An awesome game and must have for apple products!,
" Love Love this game. 
I just wish if your stuck on a level for a certain amount of time you could just pass it.",
 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to write here Great game. Although u shudnt b forced 2 buy things with $. First bec. it's expensive second bec. that's not a part of the game and third bec. some players (kids especially) have restrictions.,
 IM ADDICTED AND I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH! Fantastic!!,
 Good It is a good game to play while wasting time,
 Mary hand I loved this on my desktop.  Now it is on IPad I am so thrilled it is just the best thanks,

" Drop outs Can't even play a slot tournament without the app crashing, think it's time for a new update or else a new game!!!",
" Not good!! So many adverts. When your trying to watch it, it just freezes and takes such a long time to load! Sometimes it crashes and you need to start from the beginning! Picture quality isn't good, it can go blurry and it's not enjoyable!",
 Plumber Crack So fun  I totally recommend it,
" Too many crashes Far too many crashes recently and noticed that the slots have really tightened up.  Will continue to try to play, but if crashes/freezing continues, will delete game.  Don't like that it tries to take me to facebook too.  Not interested in that.  Games used to be fun.",
 Great! But... Was working fine for a few days but now it won't me log in I'm deleting then adding the app agian ill see if it works other wise would have been 5stars :(,
 GREAT Great game this is keep up the good work,
 Candy crush Did get up to 400+ but changed email and now back at start for third time so not impressed,
" Johnbri Love the game however, just got my new iPhone and I'm starting all over from scratch. Close to 2000000 coin down the drain. Plus all my characters. But still love playing it",
 New update just crashes I can't play since I downloaded the new update - it just crashes on loading every time. Turned my iPod off and on again but it made no difference.,
 Good game It's very adivte game for kids to look after animals,
 Robot Transfering My friend has 5 Cardinal chaoses and he wants to send one to me so I am asking if any game developers are reading this to enable robot Transfering.,
 Slots Don't know won't let me play.,
" Patience required Its buggy - spent about 10 times trying to log in. Surprised myself how many times I tried

A big bag of patience required for updates too. Hold your nerve and only use gems when you have to or have deep pockets

I'll play for a bit longer. Fills in the gaps whilst I'm waiting for clash of clans troop builds. If they iron out the bugs it has potential

Update to review : after playing it for a number of months playing:
Great game but it keeps crashing during a raid
Please have some stability",
" Ooookkkayyyyy This is a good game I have to say, but there are a few things I don't like about the game. First it crashes sometimes which is kinda irritating, next make it easier to get gold coins to get Zeus ( I have Zeus) , next WHY THE HEAK is atom a uw1 robot!!! He should be in the same class as Zeus , and the mystery draw card thing is hard ( that is how I got Zeus ) with the gold silver and bronze. The new update came and the 4 new bots are really cool especially Fiend. There are some irritating glitches that I would like you to fix. First of all it doesn't let me play against Zeus in the free sparring mode. Next sometimes when you are at main menu it doesn't let me swipe to see different angles of my robot. Also I have fiend and when I beat Zeus in the championship mode and it shows fiend with the belt and his midsection is invisible! Weird! Plz add another update to fx These irritating problems. Thx for reading. (when is global multiplayer coming?)",
 Dungeon Keeper You should make another game like this nice job !!!!,
 JD Very addictive fun gaming,
 Awesome Great for keeping the kids entertained at appointments - and awesome for me all the other times.... Hehe,
 hard game you need time or lot of money<U+3002>i spend more than 3k and still nobody in the game<U+3002> got zero one day because im at work.if you are rich this game is build for ya<U+3002>you can feel like a king<U+3002>but rich means spend more than 20k<U+3002>,
" Aussies are Disadvantaged I am currently on level 53 and am totally addicted to the game. The co op I belong to are some of the nicest people I have ""met"" and we are always helping each other out. I've made a lifelong friend with an American player and when playing today and chatting to her for more than two hours she requested another helping hand. I had already sent one to her and she sent one to me at the beginning of our play. After the two hours she requested another helping hand whilst I still had a further 4 hours to wait until I could request another. How come USA players get one every two hours??? And I also discovered that once you reach 20 million coins they don't accumulate any further so basically now I sell stuff and don't get any coin for it. That's downright rude. I have spent many real dollars on this game.",
 Casino Love these games awesome awesome awesome. My Favourite by far. Come on big bucks.  Double downs excellent always new games but Noveau Riche is my favourite atm. It rocks <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D>,
" Shhaihshshhzusbsn Pretty good, it's a great time passer haha",
" Over all good game. It's a good game, however I like to make my farm look nice. I've started to 'decorate it' but I can't get any further because there is a limit on decorations? I don't understand the reasoning. I like to put paths through my whole farm, but I can only pave 1/16th of it (for example). If you like playing the game for the missions etc, then it's great, but I like playing these sorts of games to decorate. (I'm the person who plays the sims just to build and furnish the houses, I don't actually play with the people.)",
 Keeps them busy The kids love this game it makes them laugh.,
" Error I was tring to purchase a 99.99$ gift packet and it said I had 104.99$ in my account and it said insufficient credit so I can't buy the packet, please fix this error",
 Awsome!!!! Keep it up OTM! This is like the only game I play when I have wifi!!! Idefinitly reccomend this app for everyone!,
" Candy crush What a frustratingly addictive game. Love the challenges, variation on screen layout and best of all, love the timed ones.",
" This is a terrible app. I love subway Surfers, don't get me wrong this used to be a great game! But it needs a serious update. It takes about 10 minutes to load up and then keeps redirecting me to download another game when I'm click the cross! When the game eventually does start, it freezes every few seconds and doesn't let me slide up or down! The character just crashes into the posts! If it had a an update that worked that'd be great.",
 A fun game to play Very addicting - would like it more if the time for quests are reduced,
 Love this game This game helps me pass the time during my day!!!!,
 Love it Quality,
" Good but can be better! Nice game! But seriously, full energy only allows you to examine a scene 5 times? I reckon people quit playing because they have to wait for too long!! Love the mysterious element of the game, but certainly don't love the wait!",
" Good game My biggest problem with the game is that when the level is almost complete, the screen gets really dark and it's hard to see what's going on. I guess it's trying to simulate the closing of the store but it is unnecessary and a little irritating.",
" Family, energy and stars Incredible game however 5 minutes is far too long to have to wait for just 1 energy it's so frustrating also it's stupidly hard to earn stars considering that is what is required to buy most things in the game also it would be incredible is the rest of the family had characters in the game",
 WRB Soooo fun and addicting must have,
" Please read I know there's gonna be a billion suggestions but can you add a thing were you can attack your clan members , they don't loose loot and you don't gain loot , but u can attack your mates . Please this would really help good clans so they can see their flaws in their base design with out lossing things <3 great game aswell",
" Casino Can't always get rewards and if I don't go in within 24 hrs, always lose out on the accumulative bonus, may be get in after 25 hrs so bonus away - be a little easier on those of us who rock shifts and not always easy to get in at specific times",
 Good game This is the best game I have possibly ever played. I mean it's so addicting i would pay a couple of quid for this game,
 Love this app I find there are a lot of games out there just like this. But I can't stop playing them.,
 Great game Nice graphics and interesting characters,
 Awesome game :) I think this a really cool game tbh it's that sort of game that you would play all day and all night who ever made this game must have literally been a GENIUS. Thank you guys for making this game possible. Though one concern could you make new power ups or new gadgets would appreciate it but GOOD GAME! Thanks,
 Subway surfers This is an amazing game with awesome things and amazing things to unlock and they are now on a tire which is amazing,
 Good I found this app pretty well formed the only bad thing I found was that it was a little hard at the start and that can put people of if it's difficult straight away,
" Love it Wasn't expecting too much from this but having played it i love this game, so addictive and fun",
 A Awesome game,
 Really? This game is funny but it really should be for teens super bad for 9 year olds it should be like for 14+,
" Great app! Has no lag at all, and can very addictive. Great user interface!",
 Doubledown casino Love all the different games reall good app for all. Types I rate five star,
" 5 star game Great game, massive challenge, only fault is that they need to sort out you can still see the status bar at the top of the screen, apart from that it's fantastic",
 Awesome game Awesome game,
 Plumbers crack Awesome and cool,
 Fun FPS! The only thing I really DONT like about this game is the ads that show up every now and then. I would gladly pay to get those taken off so I wouldn't have that distraction. This game is just like a cheesy horror movie withe bad acting and over the top make up effects. You just can't look away!,
 Didn't receive gems! I purchased 2500 gems and they money was taken but the gems weren't there!,
 Addictive! Love this game!,

" ***AWESOME GAME*** Really good game, good controls with plenty of action. Only down point, the upgrade for tech and weapons take agesssss!!!!  Sort it out lads!! Can't wait for the next one:):):)",
 :) Great game,
" Next Update Ideas You guy should lower prices to every thing in the game and WOULD YOU PLEASE LOWER THE UPGRADE TIME IT TAKES UP MY TIME WHEN I WANNA DO THINGS IN GAME!! Plus and more upgrades, troops and land expansion 
That would be cool. For the troops you should add stuff like a Witch Queen and a Wizard King. Also add stuff like hounds, wolves (I think), battle lions and battle tigers. Also add more defence stuff like dual cannons, x-bow like defence that shoots every 0.80s and lightning cannons that would be awesome. Please do some of these things but mainly do the ones I said at top and it would just make the game great so when my friend starts a war I can have my upgrades finished and have new things. Please do these thing.
Thx",
 Sick Awesome game love playing it,
" Very addictive game This game is very addictive, however the prices to unlock the another player are absolutely a rip off!",

 Gd Gd game lots to do,
" Better than the web version!! I'm addicted to this game! I played the web version, but I feel this one is better. You get unlimited water and the animals don't need to be fed at a specific time.

 Fun I like it.,
 No good I liked part of your update on October 31st. But having the animals take a week to produce is stupid. At least a day or better yet 6 hours and use water and food to shorten it to 30 min.,
" Very well made :D I've played a lot of these type of games but this has to be the best one!  it doesn't force you to buy in app purchases as much as other games. Graphics pretty good and it is a good time passer, I do recommend this :)",
" Hay day This game is amazing,you will never want to stop playing this game it is so addictive. The only thing I would change about it is that the prices are to high to buy the machines and get rid of stuff plus you normally can only buy something in more than a month because you don't have that much money other than that it is AWESOME!!!     :) :) :) :) :) :).",

" Amaaaazing! It's a really good game with good graphics and a good-simple story...I like every concept in the game, It's really cool to play...But you should fix that, Every time i finish a run, It asks me if i want it to let it post on my facebook, I denied, And after the next run...It asks me again!",
 Wicked! Fun!,
 Farm Good game,
" Level counter Can you please explain why after playing for over 3 years I am still only on level 12 while my partner who has only been playing for 7 months is sitting on level 13. We often play the same amount of time and win on average the same amount of money, could you look into my account and see if there is a problem.",
 Ballin! Good times! I wonder about the statics and dynamics behind some of those structures though!!,
 Awesome I love this game it awesome,
 It's met Great game,
" Hay Day This is a 5 star game, NO DOUBT!!!  As for downloading for free, yes, but DEFINITELY plan on spending some bucks for the needed diamonds.  give it up and pay the $100 for 3750 of them!!!

Barring the cost, it advances with each step that any player knows that it will become more complicated...Not in the way of normal
Games.  You have your farm, come to care for it, and therefore go forward.  You want to check it out all of the time.  Each advance
Challenges you more, as you have to remember more things to do. 

You can play at your own pace, design your own grounds, and have one HECK of a lot of fun with this game.  It must have taken YEARS to design it!!!  Trust me, try it, get rid of the first $100 bucks for the much needed, and cheaply returned, diamonds, and
Have more fun, with building challenges at your own rate.  This game is truly incredible....It is not gambling...You are on your own farm, the animals are adorable, and they switch animation during the seasons.  You work towards different levels, HOWever,
YOU achieve, not as a competitor, but by yourself...

Play the $100 right off, be patient and do not spend too many diamonds, and then play a truly quality game....CKT",
 Wicked the game I love this game!  Had some problems with getting requests in the game at first but seems better.,
 So awesome must play Read the title,
 BEST GAME EVER !! I love the graphics and levels of this game ! BIG credit to all who made this game ! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>,

 This game is really cool! I love this game it's so fun and really enjoyable to play! Some things I think you should add thou is that u should add getting dirty with people and showing it on the screen! Also people should have babies on here! Another thing u could add is when u have nothing to do while u are waiting for the next thing to come up somebody should call u to meet up or go on a date ! This game is really good but with these improvements it will make it even better!,
 Mean This is da coolest game eva!!!!!!,
 Great Game This is a great game with the next update you should allow the option to play the saved game on multiple devices.,
" Fun but... The gameplay is very fun. However, like most games like this you will hit a point where it's nearly impossible to proceed without spending money. The levels get difficult to the point that you either give up or spend some cash. I played it and enjoyed it but the in app purchases are a bit high, so I'm deleting it.",
" Nice app Good and entertaining app, I play it for hours but it is rigged when the bonus reels appear, when 2 of the bonus reels appear the spinning time takes longer and guess what NO THIRD BONUS, otherwise very playable",
 Can't connect to facebook Recently passed a staged that I've been stuck on and now my game won't sync to fb. A bit annoying. Otherwise addicting,
 Amazing Best game ever,
 <3 Awsome game really makes you think takes your mind of annoying people for a little bit,

" Hell yea! Awesome game! I play it all the time, but it crashes way to many times! I'm Starting to not play it because I can't even fight without the game crashing!! Please fix!!!",
 I hate it when I hit the freaking train  but I'm good with it's I hate it when I hit something but so far I'm good,
" Fun and addictive Really loving this game! Just be warned, it's very addictive! I even got my husband hooked! Do wish there was a way (aside from Tom, who I refuse to pay diamonds) to search for items in the paper. But otherwise, great game, thanks!",
" Crash Crash , crash, crash, don't think I have watched a full program with out a crash",
 Great game. I love this game. I m on it everyday.,
" <U+2661> I like this game, but I wish Kim from Australia came back!",
 T Love it,
 Subway surfers is good but I really need a jackpot and I saved up a lot of money and bought about 6 thousand mystery boxes but didn't get a jackpot. I was so dissapointed and upset which made me think this game is bad so please put more jackpots in it.,
 Mr One of the worst game server always down and bets are so high to take all your money,
 Good game Excellent,
 Subway surfers I love this game would it be possible t do a New Zealand one with kiwi icons thnx it's good fun,
 Fun but glitchy Really fun game but glitchy after 10 minutes. Gets slow and doesn't recognize taps on the screen. End up wasting my time dying because of the delay. Need an update to fix that.,
" This game Is pretty good, respect that's its strongly related to old dungeon keeper",
 Good Good million time,
" waste of $4.99 no actual racing. just a few touches of a pedal determine some race that happens that you don’t see. and then you taken to screens to tune, buy stuff. plenty of other games that actually let you drive the car around laps. Do not buy this game ever!",
 revieuwww The game is nice and cool,
 Internet connection I just downloaded the game and can't play because it says there's no Internet connection even though there is. I haven't even played it once. Please fix this bug because I really want to play it.,
 Addictive Amazing this game is soooo addictive,
 Hello It a good game I like it,
" Fabulous Great freebies and lots of choice, highly recommend you give it a try",
 Worst app Worst app I've ever used. Sort It out!,
 Update Update is not working properly. I'm logged in and try and send a gift it tells me to login that I'm not connected and will not allow me to send gift. This is the only way you get to play because there sure isn't any payouts or bonuses. Great games but way too tight. I attempt to play this everyday and have for several months the level up bar NEVER moves very unfair.,
 Cool Awesome,
 Jut cute Good,
 Crash App has been crashing all day please fix. 3 stars till you fix please! iPad app now isn't working. What's going? Please get this fixed!,
 Yay Sweeeetttttt,
 Plumbers crack The best game ever so addictive,
" Addictive What a an addictive game once you download and play you will see what I mean,  you will get some funny looks from those around you as you play but I guarantee that when they get home if not before they will be online downloading it.  Get it fast because sooner rather than lat you will have to pay for it.  Without bout the best free game around.",
" Improvement in function Been playing here 4 months. At first, many glitches. Big wins wouldn't post to my account. It would disconnect instead. But that problems seems to have been corrected. I am enjoying it very much now.",
 Highly addictive Will cause arguments with your partner!!,
 Third hero and be able to attack frenids it is fun till you have to wait so long for your troops to  upgrade but still love the game had it for a long time you should be able to get a third hero.and make levl seven wizards and stuff make it so you can pick the people you what to raid cues my mate and me have coup how is better a Nd i think it would be fun and a challenge that would make it make the game so good  and my champion 3 2 1 then a new league or just leave it at the but the best people in the world have nothing to upgrade and stuff so yea and third hero is what i would really like and the attack you frenids,
 Hey Awesome way to play,
 Game of War This is a great game one of the best I have ever played but people that are able to spend money definitely have an advantage and those who can't or don't it's a big disadvantage!!! It's fast levelling at the beginning on the game but later on it becomes much harder to do so.,
 Helps Helps being bored and long journeys,
" crashes on resume Every time I play this game, put my iPad to sleep, and then wake my iPad the game crashes to the desktop. It says trying to connect, makes some dungeon noises, then crashes.",
 Candy crush Fab,
" Decent game This game is decent for a Nascar fan.  It requires the use of basic racing strategies and is definitely challenging.  Considering it is a strategy game and not a first person racing game, I have enjoyed it thus far.  I have not had the serious crashes that have been previously reported. There seem to be minor issues only, but hopefully these get resolved...",
 Great game Awesome game good time waster,
" FarmVille 2 Awesome, addictive interactive game !",
 Real steel It is so fun I can't stop playing!!,
" Fun mmo It's not the best mmo, but it is the best on iPhone. The world feels really realistic and the way players interact is refreshing. You can form groups and go on quests together and making money in this game has great rewards. Good graphics too! No complaints really.",
 Awesome Love it & addicted!,
 Very addictive Very addictive. However the touch is so slow to respond and when you put the plate over a person a lot of the time it doesn't do anything. It makes it even more frustrating.,
 Was good but no more Used to b a great game but not anymore... After spending over £10 grand and 2B power there is not much u can do coz most players are over or near a billion and rally capacity makes it near impossible to have fun zeroing someone without mayor loses. They need to increased capacity or else this game is pretty much dead soon.... For those of u that can't spend money then delete game. U will waste your time playing it and after spending so much of ur life here u will regret it.... AVOID!,
" Great game Lots of fun, entertains everyone",
" Are you kidding me? Fun game, but extremely ad supported. Open the game, se an ad. Go to choose your robot, see an ad. Choose your robot, see an add. Pick your fight, see an ad... Everything you do, you get an ad to accompany it. It's annoying! I can't keep playing it receiving ads with everything I do.",
 Disappointing Really enjoyed this game until I got to a point in the game where it froze. I uninstalled and reinstalled and began the game again. Got to the same point and it froze again and has been like that for a week. Hugely disappointing! Update?!,
 Awesome game BUT!!! It doesn't open after the 3rd time :(,
 Dead trigger 2 Really good game runs well on iPhone 4s only problem is that blue prints should be more common as it's taking me a forever to unlock weapons,
" Update crashes I like the update -not nearly so bad as some of these reviews make out. The new single square tunneling is better imo (speaking as mainly a defender the old way was always annoying) and the layout is nice. However, when I try to log on there only seems to be a 50/50 chance the game will load and the 'please wait....' messages in game still wind you up particularly mid-attack when you automatically lose the battle. Overall the update is good even if it seems to favour defense -but then why should it be easy for others to waltz in and smash your beloved dungeon to bits?",
 Addictive Game Tremendously enjoyable game it will be even more impressive with offline play and perhaps less punishment for raiders fainting or reduce construction time,
 Awsome Subway surfer is awsome u can do awsome things and get cool power ups!,
 Great game. A whole lot of fun in a small game package.,
 Ipod 4 Crashes everytime on the nascar redline screen,
 Top Trop bien !!!,
" Absolute crap Its just as well it is FREE...Plays all the adverts (far too many of them may I add) and after 1st half of programme it then plays all the ads AGAIN but then when u wait on 2nd part, it puts it right back to the beginning of programme...SORT IT OUT OR GET RID :@",
 First game to have real strategy Must play,
 Good however This is a extremely very good game. The only downside of this game which infuriates me is that you have to have 3 friends with some report to be written before you enter a new case. I have no idea why you put this in but could you please take out so that if you don't have facebook you can automatially go to a new case other than that good game.,
" Good game! But... This game is really fun and also addicting. The reason I would have given it 4 stars is because the prices are sooo overpriced. But I figure that's not really important. But really, it's overpriced.  Other than that, good game! The characters are weird looking and why would you want to buy prince k for that much anyway? I would like maybe an upgrade for the things u get (ex. Magnets, jet pack) do it could last longer. It is also really lame for the pogo stick thing to just make it drop to the ground. I've died smacking my face into some things. Now, don't judge and say I'm a whiner, it doesn't happen too often and is not a nessecity that they need to fix. Other than that, everything fine! Sorry, I should probably stop saying that. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B> For those people who keep complaining about the game crashing, I'm not calling you whiners, but maybe your phone is bad. Before you get frustrated( again not calling u whiners just saying this just in case u might get irritated, I get irritated easily) I understand how frustrating a game crashing can be. That happened with me and terriaria mobile, but that's a different story. All I can say is, I'm playing with and iPhone 5s so that might help with the crashing. If it keeps crashing, well, just don't play it I guess. Or try this: restart your phone or double-press the home button if ur playing this on an iPhone. If u have the new iOS then find you game box and delete it by pushing it up. It won't delete the game don't worry. It'll just bring u back to the logo stuff. Anyway, thanks for sitting through this review and hope u enjoyed it!",
 Cool I love this game! <3,
 Sick This game is rad,
 Love it I love it this is the best game,
" Great way to pass time Love these games people you meet mostly kind and generous, have encountered a few stiffs, I just say wow it is a game and supposed to bf fun, problems are solved swiftly, enjoy the free stuff, almost like being at a real casino great way to pass time...the ultimate -Ama McJacques",

 Angry bird Fantastic game,
" A lot of things to say... Ok so I'm really addicted to this game. My Sister has it, she really likes it too. However My Other sister deleted it .<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0095> I don't know why but these are some things to make it better...

•A search bar to search up things from people roadside shop
•Lower the level needed to chat with members in your neighborhood
•Possibly add snow?
•Be able to make status updates maybe to try and get people to stop asking for particular stuff
•we should be able to make a profile add customize a character to show our personality
•be able to have more extensions when you get to a certain level (for those who have run out of space on their farm)
•Be able to play this game without Wi-Fi

Thanks if you add these in I'm sure my sister will re-install it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Thanks",
" Not worth it If this was a game that gave you some sort of challenge, then it would be worth paying for the new energy you need after 5 mins play. But it's not ....",

 Great Awesome game great way to spend a couple of hours,
 Awesome FPS! Excellent game play,
 Great game but I hate the dragging!! :( Very addictive game! I quite enjoy this game very much. But I get so annoyed that you have to drag the food from place to place. Sometimes i have to drag my finger a few times for it to actually move and most of the time it takes too long that the food will burn <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB> so frustrating!?!? why cant we just click on it and then click where it needs to go??? much more easier and quicker.,
 Very addictive Good as these games go it is possible to play without having to buy keys,
" I love the idea of the game..but... I love the show Wicked, so I was overjoyed that there was a game for it. The game is fun! But there are bugs that need to be fixed, please! The screen freezes when I try to click the gate to ask for keys and the one time it worked to send the request, it wouldn't work on my sisters end.

But some ideas my friend and i had is maybe there could be houses u can buy and design also maybe you could like buy furniture and flooring also i think it would be amazing if you could buy a pet that could help you fight like a Dog or a horse or even mythical creatures like unicorns also the profanity glitches out for me also maybe change the landscape for seasonal stuff like during   the winter make it so the landscape is snowy during
 the fall make the trees have no leaves during the spring an  during summer make there leaves and flowers and all type of that stuff",
 Good Great game although energy takes to long and is used up to quick unless you pay for it,
 Interesting game but unplayable! Server side disconnections and the lack of a reconnect function make this game really frustrating to play.,
 Plumber crack Plumber crack is the best I can't stop playing it once I start I can't stop it is my favorite game in the whole wide world,
" Best Eva Game This is the best most addictive game ever. It has challenges and missions to keep you entertained and it also keeps it fresh by changing the theme every couple of weeks.

 Good Good game,
 Reelsteelwrb It's good but takes ages to come back on this app would be a lot better if it came on straight away,
" Worst app! Downloaded this app on iPhone and iPad and works on neither, fails to recognise I'm in Scotland and doesn't let me watch anything. Very frustrating. Even when trying to watch it on normal Internet it re-directs me to the app so can't watch any programmes. Very disappointing.",

 THIS GAME IS A CHEAT <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2> Although I like the game I wanted to upgrade my barracks and I forgot my 2 builders were busy.i also didn't have enough money so I clicked to use gems (I had enough) and it said my builders were busy (which they were) so I clicked X and about 7or8 gems got wasted for nothing! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2>,

Great game!!!",
" Awesome, possible update ideas? Hey guys, first of all, amazing game. I would like to suggest some update ideas.
First, town hall 12-15. This will give people who have maxed out an opportunity to further progress. Along with this, a larger area to build which would mean a longer attack time to compensate for it. 
Secondly, a new troop and hero would be awesome. For a hero, a Goblin thief would be great so that the three first troops have a hero counterpart as the rest of the troops are already very powerful. Also for a troop, an idea of say a Yeti, or cavalry type troop would compensate well with the game.
Another idea would be to allow multiple people to watch a live clan war and also to be able to save replays of attacks to your iPhone/iPad/iPod memory for people who want to share attacks later. Or to upload to a YouTube channel if they wish, this would be awesome. And finally an alternate clan that is capable of holding upto 200-250 people which would be amazing for wars. Cheers!",
 Game of War It's addictive and  good fun. Nice way to chat with people from all corners of the world.,
 Coin Doubler Isn't Working My coin doubler isn't working.  Lost out on at least a couple thousand coins because of that.  SLooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow and lags.,

" Great translation to the mobile platform I've been playing this game on the web based Facebook version and my only complaint has ever been that I keep getting to a point where new levels aren't yet available. Happily a lot of the levels I've already beaten are quite enjoyable. This version of the game is a little further behind on levels, but very smooth and fun to play. I experienced some lag once but otherwise smooth sailing for the most part. I'm happy you created this mobile version. I use an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.",

 Love it I love this game! The only problem is Willow Pape is always tweeting and getting more fans. I think that we should get to tweet and gain fans too but you have to pay to tweet or you have to earn it by doing something. I think that will make the game a lot better,

 Good Good game,
 Amazing This is the best zombie game I have played awesome new update,
 Fun Great,
 Review Great game!!!!!! Loads of fun!!,
 Good game if u have the money Started off as quite good then it gets repetitive in that to advance you either have to pay out with real money and a lot of it or keep playing the same levels to get anywhere. Bit frustrating that you can only really advance by buying upgrades but after the first set you have to use diamonds but seeing as they don't come as freely as the money it really slows u down as the further u get the more you need the upgrades. Save your time and money,
" Amazing This game is so good!
A perfect polished mmo rpg.
It needs more recognition by people!!!!!!!!!!!

" Rubbish This is hopeless.  If you stop watching halfway through, it doesn't keep your place, as BBC iPlayer does.  You have to start from scratch, watch all eight, yes, eight adverts, then find where you were, watch another eight, yes, eight adverts, and only then can you pick up where you left off.",
 Great game! This is a great game. I enjoy trying to see how much more I can get ahead of the game.  I do wish Grandma and Grandpa would move a little faster:),
 Awesome This game is awesome I started off in June and now my town hall is on lvl5. I really like the part of attacking where you can take loot away. I really wish we could control our troops. Supercell please add this in the next update. I recommend this game,
" The WORST farming game ever, could be the BEST! Are you kidding me? And energy meter that only holds 20, so you can only do 20 things, there gone, then you can't do anything until the meter fills back up. Unless of course you want to spend a small fortune to play this game at all. If the meter was gone and you were allowed to play at will this could be one of the best farming games to play and has great graphics and items to buy. So very much potential, but you don't see Hay Day having a energy (play) meter! It's almost like you don't want people to play your game???",
" Good Awesome! If this game bet real money, could be the best!!!",
 Angry bloke Frustratingly leaves you wanting more,
 The best thing Best game ever love the farming experience!,
" Serious bugs Awesome game but after a while a playing it doesn't count challenges. Need 2 mega rocket in one go... Doesn't count them. Finish running 40,000m doesn't give you new challenge. Needs some work",
" Shaz Great games ,great people to chat with 
What else could be better? Oh yes I can't see where to send requests from ,I can see I have some but where do,you send them back .thanks it would be very helpful if I knew lol..",

 Amazingly Exciter for wrb5,
 LOL So much fun <U+E415>,
 Good Good,
 Addictive!!! Love this game,
 Suggestion I like the game. What I'd really like to do is to be able to also send out tweets. These tweets could also make other stars lose fans or gain as well as us.,
 Great game but has started crashing Can't open the game today it starts loading then crashes. Also doesn't work well with game centre. I keep losing my game centre friends and it keeps asking me to log in to Game Center but then says the game centre server can't connect me.,
" Another great Facebook game ported to iPad :) I was really pleased to see this game on the AppStore. I played this a lot on my laptop but don't use it so much there days, as my iPad does a lot of what I want. 

For those people that are new to the game, it is mostly a memory game, with a bit of a 'criminal' story behind it - it is not CSI! 

Yes, the energy goes down quickly but it is replenished over time. If you play daily, you get bonuses, which include orange juice and crisps that you can swap for energy if you run out. Adding friends will help in the energy department, too.",
 Awesome Awesome and sometimes challenging,
" DT2 Brilliant game, graphics and if you want it gore! Had an issue when it kept crashing but have reloaded it now. Try this, you won't be disappointed.",

" Plumber Crack This game is AWESOME, I let my boyfriend's aunt play and she said that it was addicting.

 It's awesome! I love subway surfers it's fun and you don't even have to buy characters with key just the outfits! I can't wait to play the Christmas version of this! It would be awesome if you guys made Christmas outfits for the characters. But everything else is awesome people have to get this game!,
 Addictive Awesome game :),
 Pretty Neat I agree with the review under me but I think you should be able to save the game with your email so much that you can play on different devices and I think if you find energy on different items you should be able to keep it,
 Restart How do we restart,
 Follow me. I'll follow back. Instagram. @natalieeenavarro,
 Can't connect to Facebook either :-( LOVE this game but can't connect to fb on my iPad and therefore can't sync with my progress on my computer :-( .. also drops out a lot too,

 iPhone 6 plus graphic out of frame Hey. I just come here to report an issue with this new update. It's good to have some new levels. Minor issue  that is the iPhone 6 plus will not show the full picture of the game. It's not severe since we can still play the game.,
" Great game but watch your spending This is one bloody amazing game seriously addictive and as soon as you purchase your 1st £69.99 gold pack that's where the addiction gets worse 
I have a 220 mil account in halo k54 
If you want to be at the top 
Make sure you have a spare 5k plus around 
But apart from that it's amazing and time flys",
" Slow and lags Using iPhone 5s. It was really good before but after the update to iOS 8, it has gone really slow. Even reset my phone as a new device but the game still lags. But it's working fine on my iPhone 6. Please fix it.",
 Fred Quite alright,
" Not Bad This is still a good game despite that the levels get hard to quickly, however it is still time consuming but I Would get the paid version instead of this, it's only 69p. If you want to try angry birds to see what it is like then get this first, if you like it then get the full version",
 Awesome Love it,
 The game Sick,
" No more angry birds It's not angry birds anymore, it's angry user. It's unplayable with all the ads and I removed it.",
" Yo Great game, great app",
" No good since Halloween update !!! Changed my rating to 2 stars. I'm unable to post on Facebook to receive my earned dollars and coins. The game freezes and crashes often during game play. I can only make posts on Twitter. When using my earned bucks to advance to another level, I am not given allotted amount of crowns to advance. Some when I get the rocket,my character gets hooked up in the ramps which causes me to loose. Play at your own risk and DO NOT MAKE ANY PURCHASES !!! I will NOT be playing anymore since developers will not fix these escalating issues.",
 City story metro Awesome,
 Ahhh! Love the game but for some reason I am unable to connect to app store from in-game.,
 OMG AMAZING!!! This game is the best game I have played on the App Store I love it and I'm only up to the second tech rank!!!!!!!!!,

" Still a winner... Still loving the game, the occasional messages from KKW herself are sweet, the fashion and adventures still engaging. If we can somehow update story lines a little more frequently as once you've completed one it does feel a little like treading water...otherwise still having fun! :)",
" Good buttt Great game, but I'm lv12 and still won't let me enter fight type 1 or 2. 

And the lottery thing, fix these and it's bag on, especial for a freebie ( tho I have paid 69p for some more cards )",
 Patching issues Been playing this game for some time now and had no issues great game however I went on this morning no problem but when I tried to go on it tonight i click continue and it keeps coming up patching issues and something about the size.

" Great! Just as good as on Facebook. Even better maybe, less glitches. Just harder to see on the smaller screen. At least I can get ny free spins even when im not home.",
 Not bad This game is really fun although it's way too easy to loose your diamonds! Every time I press something I have to be careful I don't press the speed-up buttons! Every time I look at my diamonds they are getting lower although I haven't intentionally used any?? Things are also getting really expensive and storage is very limited. Patience is starting to wear thin after level 20.....,

 Addictive Love it. kills time when I'm bored!,
" Fun but not perfect This game is very fun and addictive. It would've gotten a higher rating but for two major issues. First, there's a glitch with the credits at times which results in either awards being miscounted (winning $1000 but getting only $100 in your coins) or awards being subtracted rather than added.  This is very frustrating, especially on big wins! Second, after the last update, it's almost impossible to win no matter how high or low you bet. Winning is still possible, mind you, but you have to have a big bank to gamble with to get over that ""take everything"" hump.",
 Fun To Play I play this everyday to zone out and relax.,

" Love love game. In my busy and stressful life,  candy crush is the gin in my tonic,  when the kids are in bed.",
 Cool Game Good game...easy to pick up and play...addictive too,
 Little Raiders Good game,
 RR is Totes Legit!! Tons O fun. Nifty and smart. Dig it. !,
 Lots of fun and entertainment My kids started playing this and got me hooked.,
 Ok It's good,
" Awesome game, highly addictive Recommended",
 Solid ghee Yeah bruh,
 Amazing!!!!!! This is the best game I have ever played on my phone it's so addicting!!!,
" Gameplay This game on IOS 7.0.4 is not up to the standard as before the update, it features special monsters like rager and scientfist coming out of no where and emerging from right behind, during the small mission of seek and destroy, in the mine I was not once but several times surprised at how fast these special monsters come up, also the game slows down a lot during shooting and sometimes the money I earn during seek and destroy, only half of it comes into the bank? What's up with that? I earned 7,043 in money but only got 4 thousand something. I know this because if I had 7 thousand I wouldn't have had to play another mission just to upgrade the tech. Please fix this :) other than that it's an amazing game",
 Addictive! Too addictive but awesome!,
" Doubledown Yeah great

Game",
" Money maker Like some players wrote , this is a big money maker for the developers but there is s way to achieve something with very little financial input. By that I mean, whatever you to spend to get high roller in the casino. In my case it was 125$. Yep that's all I spent. I've been playing for almost a year and I'm at 350m power. Game offers events with items and gold as a reward . The key is to save whatever you have and use it in the right time. After all it a war game so you make your profits in the others.. If you want to be a ""care bear"" obviously this is not a game for you.  There  r some glitches and bugs sometimes server crash but overaly  it's really steady game. 4 stars",
 Decent Decent game really,
 Omg When I do the surveys to her credits I don't get any of the credits that i earned,
 : ) An amazing little game,
 Love it! Fun games lots of credits earned easily!,
 Addicting! Love this game! Wish energy would load faster and more clothes.,
" Could be better I have enjoyed this app for quite some time. I understand the need to update the app but it appears that no one is actually testing the updated before it is released on us. Since the last update the app has become wildly unstable, I have lost millions of chips due to game crashes. Each of the games is now very slow and crashes often.",
 Very addicting ! I love this game sleep at Night and helps me not to get stressed out so much,
 Great Game Awesome just Awsome,
 New update Cairo Hey guys I didn't even receive the newest update on my iPhone 5s still yet but on the other hand I got the Cairo version on my Samsung a day before pls sort it out asap,
" Criminal Case It's a really addictive game, great story line, really good game overall, however I do agree wi others the whole energy usage and having to pay money for stars, and logging in with face book is really annoying! Would be nice to just log in once with Facebook invite some friends and then play along!",
 Fun Love this game. So much fun. Very addictive.,
" Glitch found!! To the left of the fishing shack there is a patch of grass that looks unfinished. Very square and seems like a overseen graphics error. Love the game, no complaints; just wanted the creators to know about the glich.",
 Fantastic game I'm addicted to ds game. I think it's great. There should be other ways to earn more diamonds. And other shops to buy more items.,
 Great Great game,
 I enjoy it It's fun,
" Love It, But... I don't think that buying gold coins should be a quest. My family is poor, and we can't afford to spend money on games. On the plus side, I love the game, and the realistic animals. Btw, one of the quests tells you to grow watermelons, which cost gold coins. However, I have not found any way to earn them. Heads up, please?",
" Good game Okay I can tell you mz lots of things about what I think of this game but it would be long !! I'll do a shortened version. 

I love this game ! I've been playing for months and watched many changes been made . Some good some bad but each to their own .

First of all if new players buy a gold package maybe not jump so much . It's 2.99 then 13.99 then 35.99 then 69.99 maybe have more different offers on to let us just top our gold off.  I used to love the casino events ! Gold gold gold ! But now the stupid monster gifts are quite useless. Bring these back !! 

Also every now n then if force closes on me I'm playing on iPad 3 on a very fast connection and sometimes it force closes or becomes leggy this is not good if your under attack!  Your getting there mz just iron out more changes and your get more ppl downloading this game !! Still love not many complaints just reconsider your prices (for the poorer people) and all will be good  always loved game of war spent many sleepless nights because I'm so addicted . 

Keep up the good work",
 Awesome Awesome because it's with heaps o people an u can play with them,
 Brilliant! Love it!,
 Great game Good graphics and gameplay. Get downloading!,
 Over rated You need energy it looked better than it was,
 !!!!! It's about time I can log back in to Facebook to play,
 Fun It's s fun game,
" Ruth w Enjoyed it at first but now there never seems much to buy. Things like champagne take far too long to make. Not much challenge at the moment. Also I am unable to connect with ""friends"" from facebook. Help please. Oh yes, and sometimes the ""helping hands"" don't turn up!",
 Great but... I play on world sulis and everyone is great. LourboyFX is my warrior and I'm loving the new places. I hope u will add boats trips from the docks to places. The thing which needs changed the most is gold drops. It needs to be higher for it takes ages to get gold at a low lvl and low lvled people needs the gold the most. Keep up the brill work ur doing. :D,
" I pad frustration Keeps dropping out wont reload just totally frustrating playing in tournaments waste of time . Very disappointing not enjoyable any more.  .. 
 Has asked me to rate this is a minus sign available? Need to rate as one star as will not let me send without rating it  no stars is my rating!",

 Very addictive Very good gamme but turtle should not die straightway atleast give more powers to use in game,
 woo hair styles are too expensive that's the only downfall with this game.,
 Yer Great,
 1 flaw Great game very addicting. Only flaw is I don't get the daily spin due to it saying can't connect to store or server.,
 Subway surfers I love the game because it is so challenging,
 Great Just grabbing items,
 FARMUP!! The game is pretty good except instructions are non existent apart from at the very beginning when you play for first time. Some areas are puzzling because you don't know what to do. Otherwise not a bad game.,
 King Awesome game really good worth getting. I just don't agree with some proper wicked games only to be played with Internet/wifi... What about if you don't have all that? But hay good game. :),
 Five star Brilliant,
 Keeps my 4 yr old entertained for days Great,
" Great I love the new design, it's definitely still fun and addictive. The new boards are awesome and super-flashy! Subway Surfers is AWESOME!",
 Farm up Awesome game,
" Won't open This app does not work because location detection is faulty.
Why not use the code from the desk top version which does work from the same IP address?",
" Energy, Stars, Free Time The energy doesn't load quick enough, and most times you never have enough to do a task so you lose fans. You also get energy a lot when you have full energy but nine when you need it, I keep getting only two stars on appearances because I never have enough energy and its downgrading the fans I have.
All of the hairstyles, clothes and jewellery are to be bought with stars and we never build up enough, so we can never buy anything new. 
We never have time to go on dates because there are always activities given to us so we can never fulfil getting married but overall good so far. Last thing when you are dating someone if you don't call them in one day they break up with you so you can't get married and move up the top couples list.",
 Excellent Great time killer.,
 Follow on ig I follow back and like pics <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>,
" Exactly what I wanted... Very fun game, combining a tiny tower type game mixed with a fun little adventure. My only problem is that it has to connect to the servers to play, this would have been a brilliant offline game.",
" Where did my app go?? FIX IT!! I installed the Fall update last week and the app disappeared from my phone!! When I go to the app in the app store now, it has an option to ""open"" the app, but I still have no app on my phone! WTH did it go? Fix it!! It's been over a week now! Ughhhhhh.",

 <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9> It's annoying when u get bad spins every day/ just make us start with 1milliom gosh,

 Farmville2 Totally addictive,
" Awesome but a little bit easy later Compare with others, the game has great graphic and colors, and the controlling responses quickly and accurately ,it is one of those games you won't feel frustrated about it along the way, yet the game lacks of further challenges after u get your first 10000 meters , the game just sends those familiar obstacles again and again",
" Dd casino is a Bust! Down for maintenance a lot. Slow to load often, and often take away chips or ""loses them"" weather you buy them or not. I bought 500,000 chips once .. It loaded them and a hour later they simply vanished. Never got a response from them either. Waste of time.",

 Hello It is a good game I like it,
 Great Except if you download it on another platform on the same apple ID and game centre you don't get your coins or characters back :<,
 Love the game BUT... I have been playing this game around a year and have 4 characters over level 100 its a fantastic game however without buying in app purchases dont bother you may aswell delete it now it costs so much for the items and mobs pay u so little so prepare to pay to play or my advice is look else where,
 A Good,

 Mega Fame Casino Good game. Pays often.,
 Bad glitch Simon called me telling me I needed to do a photoshoot that I never even heard of before at muse magazine and when I went to do it I found that muse is locked. Now I have no way to accomplish anymore goals. What's the point of playing this game if it doesn't even work properly?,
" Great fun, but I like this game it's very fun and enjoyable but the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because when you run out of energy cores you have to wait about 7 mins to fight again, so please change that, thx",
 Love I love this game I'm always playing it .,
" Total crashes I brought this game as it look good but the game crashes all the time. Have to re load about four times per race, stay clear.",

" Terrible Isn't the idea of games that they're meant to be fun or challenging?

Where is the fun on clicking to make a minor upgrade to a room, and then waiting a week for the upgrade to complete? 

Where is the challenge in taking the alternative approach and paying big money to make upgrades?

The original Dungeon Keeper was one of the great computer games. This version is a miserable, venal, travesty of a game.",
 To I can't play this f  kin game,
" Cool game I enjoyed the management and strategical part of this game. Would definately recommend, although its not an actual racing game.",
 OMG Best fu**ing game ever!!!!!!,
 Awesome TD While it may be annoying how long it takes to dig out room and tunnels at the start it's still awesome,
 GOLEM KING!!!!!! This is a great game and im in love with it I recommend it to everyone. I think they should add the golem king. Because like y not i mean its the GOLEM KING!!!! Nothing gets better than that,
 Djdbndnx Oddly addictive,
" Great game but!!! This is a great game, but it makes you have to spend heaps to get items. Most items early require gold, but later they require tickets and that just means spending more. A little disappointing I think",
 Great game This game is so addictive and amazing,
" Fun for a while Fun for a while, but the novelty wears off when you realise silly items like a pair of glasses costs up to 3000, yet a job only pays you around 200 at a time. Bearing in mind that a job can take up to 8 hours and I don't have the time nor energy to complete it.

I'm an A lister, yet I can't afford to buy any luxuries. It's clearly just a ploy to try and get people to spend real money on the game.

Also, why do I have to constantly use K stars to charm my date, even when we're engaged? I've bought a wedding dress that I don't like for a ridiculous amount of money and paid a lot to keep the venue, just to end up with no K stars/money left because my date gets insecure every couple of days! What a waste!",
 Great Game I am addicted to this game,
" Typical EA failure again No surprises that EA actually expect me to spend money on a game that doesn't work. I haven't been able to log in for over half a day now, game crashes every time I complete a mission or upgrade a building. No I know why EA is voted as one of the worst software companies in the USA",

" Clash of clans review This game is fun and addicting. Once you start playing it, you will be absorbed in improving your village and destroying others. Later on though, upgrades cost a ton and they take forever. Overall, this game gets a 8.5/10 from me.",
 Surprised Quite easy and quick game to play anywhere. What else u want?,
 Fun! Great game!!,

" Fun... But This is a fun game but some of the items take way too long to grow.  8 hours for a lemon, really?  In this sense you need to have patience and warm up to the fact you will not be able to achieve all the goals they set.  But it is fun and a time killer when needed.",
 Love hate I love this game but I hate that I am so addicted lol :P,
 Crushin' it! A fantastic game to keep the brain active!,
 TOM!!!! WASTED 15 diamonds thinking Tom would be able to look for market stakes!!!! Then had to wait 2 hours each time before I could use him again!!! Waste of sacred diamonds I want them back!!!!!,
" Dead Trigger 2 The game is fun to play with excellent graphics. However, the major issue with the game is the constant shutting down of the game.  This was a major flaw in the first version and remains in DT2. 

I would not recommend this game unless the constant shutting down has been resolved.",
 Awesome game! So much fun,

 Subway surfers Top game,
 Dumb game Don't waste your money,
" Ruined by micro transactions The game seems like it would be enjoyable if it weren’t for the fact that wait-times stop you from playing for more than a few minutes a day, unless you’re prepared to spend money on the ridiculous amount of in-app purchases. Don’t waste your time or money with this game.",
" Totally addictive to make it short and sweet, this game is great to play and keep busy with. I'm having a bit of trouble with some missions not popping up but, other than that, I still love this game!",

 Crash!!!!! Just got this app.... Have had a few fights now but just as I start to make some progress the game is crashed....... Now it won't load the game at all..... 5 stars if there was no crashing so please please fix this!!!!,
" Great game, new update??? Hey everyone! If you are looking for an awesome MMORPG to play, this is the game for you. I highly suggest this game for it's high graphics, speedy updates, and great storyline. Even after you've completed the game and have reached maximum power, you still aren't done! The great amount of fast new updates allow more fun as they add new items and opportunities! Plus you always have you social life, where you can chat and connect with players all around the world! This is a great, Must - get game.
Now i have a couple of questions and wishes. First off, could you please add some capes? If this came up in the next update, this would really re-ignite my passion for the game. Second, could you add horses? Being able to ride horses would certainly  make hundreds of players joyous. Thank you for all your time and fun, and keep working on this game! It's a winner, and i shall continue to support it so long as you continue to support us with your quick yet wonderful updates! ;)",
 Good game Very gd game,
 Legendary. Love the new freebies too,
 In-App purchases ruin it It could be a good game but like most games with in-app purchases the use it as a way of limiting game play. This would be fine except it is SO restricted you play for a minute or two until you hit that limit. Not nearly long enough to grab your attention and want more. In-App purchases are that of greedy developers. Just let me pay one price and be done with it.,
 Mobile Data Error Game doesn't work with Mobile Data and occasionally not with Wi-Fi. As for the game if you are  expecting anything close to the original awesome Dungeon Keepers you'll be disappointed with this awful game if you want something to keep you occupied on a smoke break and on the loo this will do.,
 Great game This is a great game but it needs to take away ads and add more ways to control the people instead of just jump you should have duck and jump,
" Addictive! Too addictive! So much to do, so little time! Start at you own peril!....",
" Awesome Skeet skert said the cow, I love this game not just doing this for the reward",
 Joan. 69 It's pretty fun because you can do all kinds of stuff and you gat a lot of coins. I like building the houses but it takes to long about 5 minutes.,
 Clan tournaments I really love this game 1000000000000000000000% and this will make it 100 times better if there was clan tournament where your clan practises fighting each other for clan wars. This is what happens. You have a button down when you tap on the clan castle down like where you are upgrading it. Then  when you press the button it says are you sure when you press yes you sign in for a clan tournament you get 1 hour to train troops then when two people are online and they have signed in they fight  troop vs troop. The winner that kills all the enemy troops wins 1000000 gold and elixir and the loser wins nothing they can only play 2 times a week there is no time in the battle  and it has to be a fair fight for next update plz do it supercell plz,
 Fix please Game freezes up right after I complete the very first statue puzzle.,
 Love it So addictive! Really enjoy it. Only thing I don't like is that its too easy to click on the wrong thing and lose valuable diamonds. Wish there was a 'are you sure' option on 'spending' diamonds.,
 Awesome game first play Well the game is awesome but weird,
" Wtf, I can't even play the game Me and my brother do not want to share the same village, I've tried to disconnect but nothing is working. I've made several new Game Center accounts and they have not worked or helped me in any way. I've made my decision, I hate this game and will not download it again unless my problem gets fixed",
" Needs an update please It won't let me buy credits, it says the transaction has already been made but it hasn't. Really needs an update <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>",
 Stahp opening on me for no reason I only downloaded this app to hopefully stop being redirected to it every 3 minutes but it doesn't seem to have done much. Whoever designed it to be like this is an oxygen thief. Boo-urns,
" Fun game A little time consuming but none the less a very fun game, my GF hates that I'm addicted to it lol...",
" Great Great game, shame about the cost of gold, but great",
" FUN BUT EXPENSIVE!! This is a fun game but having to buy diamonds is expensive why can't we use coins to unlock toolboxes??  Why must we have to keep purchasing and wasting money on diamonds we should be able to use coins.. Should be able to buy tom ""errand boy"" with coins also",
 Fun Fun,
" Offensive. Its terrifying that today in society a game that includes a murder and autopsy is considered fun. Definitely not suitable for children, this app should be for 18+ Or deleted altogether, this sort of violence gives unstable people bad ideas.",
 Josh The best,
 Ok Takes a longggg time to load,
 Good slots Yes they are,
 Fsjejfb Best game very addicitive,
" Really ? People only rating this game 1, 2 or 3 stars . You're out of your mind . Best game ever u people are way to picky its a free game jeeze",
 Farm game Really fab game worth getting x,
 Pula Great,
 Buttcrack Cool game I like it,
 Miss Great addictive game,
 Do what the other guy said When it says checking location keep tapping the right corner then it should work like. It has for me.,
" Love it! Hate the three day wait to unlock the next case, other than that so addictive and really clever!",
 Cool I really like it. It's fun to play,
 Great fun Easy to follow and good fun,
 Developers please help!:/ Absolutely love this game but recently the game keeps force closing on me. I've played multiple times before with no trouble. I have an iPhone 4s and I'm updated to iOS 7 please help!,
" Good but not perfect I like the game style, similar to a TD game. The only problem is the high imp costs, 3rd builder for 800 crystals!",
" DONT DOWNLOAD All the developers want is money. Constant advertisements. Take clash of clans. They have very expensive prices for gems but at least you can play the game without all these ""special offers"" which just try to rip money off you. Do not download unless you are prepared to spend your life savings on the thing.",
 Love it I love this game is so addicting,
 Not good The usual high standard of incompetence....app will not load anything remotely television like...,
 Great game Great little game,
 Addictive Good fun but can be frustrating,
 It's ok. Had a few glitches when making purchases and ended up paying twice for one purchase. This has happened a few times. Wait time on some things is just way to long. And why is there a progressive insurance banner on my farm. I didn't get this app to have adds for insurance put infront of me.,
 Love this game Love this game,
" I love you guys Before I was just played sometimes but since last 1 month, I dont know why but I was getting fall in love with this game and now, u made 'Seoul' tour!!!! Which is my home town!!!! So fantastic guys! Im really really happy with this update. Thanks guys again :D",

 Fun This is a gd game,
 Bocy Vsrb fayibdt vsyhlpovdat. Gdayjbdj,
" Good game but there are some glitches Really enjoying the game and the strategies involved to progress. Really takes the ""bejeweled"" style game to another level!! But Creators can you PLEASE fix the glitches in the game. For some reason my star scores aren't being added and I can't ""visit"" the wizard since entering Gallikin land. They are staying on 5 or 6 even though I've progressed up 3 more levels. Also even though I'm on my FB account it doesn't sync my game achievements to my other devices, even when backed up to iCloud etc.",
 Could be better Why is it when I always play it on my iPad then I decide to play it on my computer I had to start the game from the beginning I should be able to play on eat her and be at the same level and pick up where I left of.,
" Network Error Worst app ever. 0 stars (have to rate at least 1 unfortunately).
Almost constant 'Network Errors', often followed by time outs/loss of match (not my phone, everything else uses network fine when this app can't).

If you want an app that makes you want to smash your iPhone into tiny little pieces from frustration, then this app is for you.
Shame because the game itself is really good...",
 I love to play I feel like I'm really a farmer taking care my farm and doing my business. I enjoy a lot. Although I wish we could have the FarmVille 2 be allowed on iPhones and iPads also so would be much quickly for as to transfer ours waters and produces between farms instead we have to go to a PC to do it.,
 Yep Sssoooooooo must get its just 1 of those iPod games that just work,
 Awesome game Awesome game lots of cool games I love it also big wins in games,
 Game reset Thoroughly enjoyed this game until I opened it today and it had reset to level one. I was nearly at level 400! Livid.,
 Brilliant zombie game Fun hard to start but when you get used to it a lot of fun good graphics and gameplay,
 Casino games Love all the games and the new ones keep  coming thank you,

" Unhappy I've been unable to get into doubledown casino 
For months. I'm on Facebook ,my iPad has been updated to iOS 7 and I still can't get into said game.If I didn't have so much money to spend I would delete this game.",
" Keeps crashing I've suddenly been reduced to level 1, and I'm unable to do anything at all. I was about to finish the event, but I have lost EVERYTHING and can't even move the screen focus.",
 Free gold Whoo whoo free gold!!!,
 Good fun game Good times! Challenging friends to a game of poker in the pub!!,

 Just Love It!!! Really enjoy playing just wish I could win more hopefully my luck will change!!,
 This is the app!!! I think this is a game for 7 and up and I really like how they move to city's it is really cool and I like how you can dress your person. If you we're 7 years or over get this app.,
" OMG I love this game. Before I got it and the ad popped up so many times i saw the game as a terrible game that younger children would play. I eventually got sick of the ads popping up so I downloaded the game and only then I realised that I loved it and I got addicted to it. There is one slight problem though. I am on level 24 and I have just started saving to open the mine. The problem is that I need 21 000 coins to open it up. That is a big jump from the 14 000 for the boat. If these prices could come down that would be great because I am sure that not everyone has a million dollars stashed for when you have to open something. I also have a couple of suggestions, could the game be able to connect even when I have no wifi or when you don't have wifi you can't visit other farms or read the newspaper, be able to find friends not just through Facebook (because I don't have it), there be a section in the newspaper where you can search up an item that you would like and there would be all of the farms that have it on sale,have Tom all the time and not pay diamonds to get him, having cocoa beans and a chocolate machine so that you can make different types of chocolate and that when you level up you get a certain amount of things like axes,TNT,shovels, saws,nails etc. Thank you for taking your time to read my review and hopefully there are more exciting updates to come",
 Great Very addictive .. Excellent game.. Bad for battery life tho ... Can't put it down... Great to while away the hours..,
 Good Very good game lose time a lot of exciting,
 Awesome Love this game.,
 Great Great game so fun,
 Farmville 2 Super fun game but kills my cell phone battery really fast!!,
 GEMS WHY SO MANY I like the game but you need to many gems for every purchase so why bother,
 AMAZING! It's so addicting! I just can't put it down!,
 Addicting Don't play if you're prone to addiction.,
" QUALITY This game is brilliant so addictive, it's the first thing I look at in the morning and it's something that you can keep going back too all day, been playing it for nearly a year now and still not bored of it!",
 Good Games Excellent slots but keeps on taking too long for reels to stop resulting in messages popping up all the time...Lobby or Continue.....very frustrating....,
 Best game I've played so far This game is feeling awesome!! I definitely recommend this to any game freaks..,
 Lexi So addictive,
 Fun Fun,
 Sick Game is good but it took me ages to get 15k and next time I went on the game it was gone,
 Slots Excellent game,
 Ummmm.... I'm not exactly Ure what to say about this app I love vein able to wayh stv portably but you still have to watch the adverts as it dosnt let you skip them I find this really really annoying its gotten worse recently used to he three now its seven,
 Good All good,
 Great Great,
" Awesome and addictive The game is the fun and I really enjoyed playing it. It can be very addictive especially when you first started it... The only problem I have I had was I used up my diamonds (maybe around 29  diamonds) accidentally by clicking the thunder sign all the time, its mainly because I have big fingers or I m very excited to harvest all them crops, bake, loom, using the feeding machines.. Other than that it is a good family fun game! 

Rooms for improvement: Maybe try to put the thunder sign somewhere else but nearby...? :)",
 Subway surfers It is the best game ever,
 Yeah Love it,
" So addicted! Can't get off this game but definitely needs some improvements. If we get married the next update should be that we are allowed to have kids. We also should be able to write our own tweets, why should Willow get away with saying rude things to us when we can say something witty back.",
 Game Great,
 Energy / experience / babies It takes too long to gather energy and what if you do not have a Facebook account or no friends on the game centre then half of the items you will never be able to access. You should be able to purchase experience in some form it takes way to long to level up and hopefully you're working on bringing babies into it.,
 Angry birds Great game,
" Freakin amazing Love this game
Suggestions

Shorter time waiting for energy

More important tasks

Designing clothes ourselves?

Have children

Interact with husband/ wife more like have actual conversations

Rest of kardashians and jenners",
 . Good,
" Rubbish Couldn't even use it! Said 'Checking Location' for about half an hour even on the wifi! Gave up, wouldn't bother with it.",
 Farm up The best farm game it's so addictive love it!! <3,
" a real blast Love the game. I unlocked the roulette exclusive bot. He's basically Noisy boy with Midas's heavy attacks. I wouldn't waste too much time trying to get Zeus though. He's the equivalent of 40-50 real world dollars. There will be a lot of farming for everything, just as a side note.",
" So addictive Kept me occupied for ages now. Really addictive, great game",
" Hmmm... >:( It looks like a fun game to play but the worlds are either full or offline, am I doing something wrong? :( If not, please add more worlds so the newbies like me can have a go at the game! kthnxbai.",
 Good game It's a good game one question is it online if not UPDATE,
" game It's really good game! but , you should probably add more cash somepeople are probably broke. :/ and make some places more cheaper! and add more K cash!",
 Perfect This is a great game a bit laggy but that's probably my phone but wow is this game good,
 Fun Having lots of fun.,
 Crap Crap,
 Little raiders Awesome game,
 Good game Yes,
" Taken 2 years of my life I play it everyday, it can easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny. I love it.",
 Please fix the problem I love this game but since last update can't play. Game won't open. Very frustrating. Please please fix it.,
" App closes when phone rings I would have given 4 stars but when I am playing and the phone rings, the app closes and my score isn't saved. It would be preferable for the game to pause instead",
 AmaZing Love it!!,
 Hours of mindless fun This game provides hours of mindless fun. Enjoy!,
" Annoyed I can't gain anymore fans, when I have an event and I get the feedback it doesn't come up with the fans that you would normally gain",
 rose Used to be really good. Now its dead boring. Love (not) how the wind up music to bonus rounds plays AFTER you see you've missed out AGAIN!   I'm outta here ....,
 So fun Love this game so much,
" Not bad Just started playing, it's not to bad so far. Pretty entertaining",
" Best 1st Player Out Out There Love it! Controls are easy to use. Appears easy, but gets difficult as it progresses .",
" Updates!! Love the updates & the fact that my suggestions are being added <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>.. I should totally be on board as a payee lol.. Ok, few more ideas.. So, I love the private jet idea! Too bad I can't afford it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094>.. Here's a tip! For those who can't afford cars or private jet, how about a car service?? Sounds cool right!? Bc I'm the fashion icon of the yr & I'm still catching the bus <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9>.. & can we visit our Husband at his job? Or can he just follow us to our events too as well.. & for futuristic ideas we need a BABY! You can add maternity clothing to make us look pregnant! And we should be able to tweet from our events.. It's no fair that our frenemies can but we can't.. So these are just a few suggestions.. Thanks doll <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>",
 4 stars Boring but also fun,
 Fun Game! Enjoy the game but agree there could be a want board and upping the storage is too hard. Other than that I love the game!,
" Great game, but... Five thousand dollars is written '$5000' not '5000$'. Everything else about this game is awesome but for dollar rewards put the dollar sign in front of the value.",
 UPDATES!!!!!!!! I think that this game needs like a daily reward that you get every day like everyone there should be like elements of barracks or something like that oh and I think that if your base is full you can expand you land or whatever and I think there should be like a troop a lady troop that has powers of nature and that troop you can buy is right after P.E.K.A what about new SPELLS!!! There should be a rise from the dead spell that cost gold and elixirs oh and what about a lady troop that freeze whatever she hits every two hit thanks plzzzzzzz it will be a miracle,
 :/ Ok here it goes i had this game for like 3 months and i got addicted to it and I was thinking about it at school and I couldn't sleep this game puts to much pressure on you and messes up your life im sorry :(,
 Great Great,
 Amazing Just amazing,
" BoganSamurai Pretty cool game, close all other apps before playing to stop crashing!",
 Great fun !!! Great fun !!!,
" Time <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E> It takes too long to get energy. Also it's quite hard to get stars and the best clothing there is, you have to use stars to buy it.",
" Could be better The games fun and exciting, but it's needs a couple more tweaks, needs to be reformatted for iPhone and iPad, also you can't even buy cards with Clintz unless someone's selling them, I remember when you could purchase fresh packs with Clintz instead of only just Credits, but like I said it's still fun and entertaining, just could be better.",
 This game is awesome Look guys this game is so good but if you can do some updates on it it will be the best game ever It will even beat clash of clans,
 Addictive Love this game!!,
 Awesome It's an awesome game just not very addictive.Its not as good as angry birds rio thpugh,
 What enhanced graphics?? The game still looks the same. Please make characters look better.,
 Farmer Addictive,
 Clash of clans Wow wooooooow,
 Gg Good game,
 Great and addictive A game that is not totally reliant on customers money,
 Doesn't load Would actually give a proper review if I could actually get the game to load even once. Have installed and tried to play 6 times and it has crashed each time. Well done. Deleted,
" yawn snoozefest, even though i loved the original.
very long loading times between screens, its painfully dull

EA just keep on grossly misunderstanding mobile gaming, whilst the nimble supercell are cleaning up.",
 Game of War Very interesting game. Good learning game for History buffs. Time consuming but fun. Very enjoyable.,
 Sick as Fun funny fantastic,
" Worst app of all time This ""app"" is probably one of the worst apps so far. You cannot rewind or fast forward the programme and after sitting through the repetitive advertisements the programme has sound but yet no picture. So if you cancel your view and restart you are brought back to the very beginning for the programme and if you wish to start off from were you left you are forced to watch the very same advertisements again. It really a waste of time to download this app.",
 Great game Awesome fun,
 awesome awesome game,
 AWSOME! got the game today and already addicted To it great game worth downloading 10/10,
 Big Fish Casino I enjoy this casino app and continue having a great time. Thank you for the fun,
 Yay It's a great game when your bored love it,
 Was good but not Like what you have done exclusive robot and the trophy room but pls sort the lag it lags so much I even deleted games to reduce lag but it won't go and I have 18.8giga bytes on my iPod,
 Adverts ruin it Deleted due to adverts,
 GREAT GAME!! Its fun and entertaining yet mind tactics are needed!,
 Plumber crack This game is really good and I love the way the graphics are so good cos on ma bb the graphics on free games aren't very good!!!!!,
 good very  good,
" Internet connection issues making raiding impossible I will ""lose connection"" to the Internet every time I search for a raid. Sometimes, I will lose connection during a raid, and i relaunch to find I have lost a considerable amount of trophies. There is a net issue that needs addressing.",
 Addictive Weirdly can't stop playing,
 Time waster It starts off too hard to continue playing. Could have been south better if it gave you more to do at the start other then wait for your energy,
 Cool Cool,
 Mitchell(1999) A well balanced game. It reminds you of the real thing and plays like the real thing. I like it,
" I love it This is a great game I love it.but I'm asking if you could make it in Boston and make snow and maybe In Australia.

 Incredible game Best game I've played in a long time. The developers did a terrific job with it!,
" Please read supercell!!! 3 new ideas defence dark barracks and spell! Congrats on 2 years, I have been playing for 1 and a half years. I've gotten half my school into the game and they are, HOOKED to it. The new spell should be like a target chooser but only the troop type you choose in your attack and they all go for it. Lvl 1 you can choose 20 of the same troop to move. Lvl 2 could be 25 troops move. Lvl 3 30 troops move to the target. Make it so you upgrade your spell factory to lvl 6 but you can't add another spell, so still 5 spells max. Lab cost for upgrade 8 million. To upgrade spell to lvl 2 costs 5000000. To upgrade to lvl 3 costs 8000000 elixir. Also new dark barracks troop it can in stealth mode when on low health like 20 health. It has 500 health it takes up 15 room it's attack damage is 100 per second after it heals itself up to 100 health and can't do it again. It costs 3250000 to upgrade dark barracks and adds 15 room to it max lvl is lvl 1. It costs per troop 300 dark elixir. Also new defence, spotter short range unlocks at lvl 10 town hall max lvl 1 costs 4000000 gold and you can buy 4 and it's 2x2 room it does 15 damage per second and can affect only that dark barracks troop and pekka and golem (increase hit points of those 2 by 150) it is only single target but very good. Please please please read this supercell and consider it I hope you do. I really love playing this game!",
" Help! I thought the game data would have been synced with Game Center but when I reinstalled the game (due to glitches), everything was reset.. I kinda want my money back coz I've paid for a bit of stars.. Ok so the glitches I'm experiencing are: 1. I can't call in-game contacts to come for my photo shoots.. The only available contact is my game center friend and they're dating me, so no professional rewards! 2. I can't watch videos to get free stars or money anymore.",
 Awsome It's awsome,
" Ace Such a brilliant game, so addictive",
